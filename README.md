- Different views - toggle between weeks/months/years view
- Color themes - let users choose different color schemes
- Add years labels - number the rows so you can see "Age 20, Age 30, Age 40..."

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the "Life Calendar" concept - visualizing life in weeks to encourage living intentionally and making the most of our limited time.
