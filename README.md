A visual representation of your life in weeks. See how many weeks you've lived and how many you have left based on your life expectancy.

## Features

- Visual grid representation where each box = 1 week
- Green boxes show weeks you've already lived
- White boxes show weeks remaining
- Each row represents one year (52 weeks)
- Motivational quote to inspire action

## How to Use

## Future Improvements (Planned)
- Add a small box explaining "Green = lived, White = remaining"
- Add a hover effect to show "Week #, Year X, Age Y" while hovering over a box
- Milestone markers - highlight special weeks like birthdays 
- Download/share - button to save the visualization as an image
- Different views - toggle between weeks/months/years view
- Color themes - let users choose different color schemes
- Add years labels - number the rows so you can see "Age 20, Age 30, Age 40..."
- Animation - boxes fade in one by one when calculated


## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the "Life Calendar" concept - visualizing life in weeks to encourage living intentionally and making the most of our limited time.
